# Mobile-Document-Scanner


Steps I have followed while creating this document scanner using OpenCV

1. Detect edges.
2. Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
3. Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
